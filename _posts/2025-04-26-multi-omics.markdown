<p class="intro">Multi-omics integration aims to combine multiple layers of molecular data—such as transcriptomics, proteomics, epigenomics, and metabolomics—from the same set of biological samples. One powerful approach for integrating multi-omics data is matrix factorization, a family of dimensionality reduction techniques designed to uncover hidden structures or patterns shared across different data types.
