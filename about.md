  <p class="intro" style="font-size:1.2rem;">
  I am Menna Arafat, a physician and bioinformatician working on computational modeling of biological systems, with a focus on multi-omics integration and machine learning. Over the past five years, I have contributed to projects across genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, using both bulk and single-cell datasets. My main interest is in developing frameworks that characterize the molecular architecture of disease and identify therapeutic vulnerabilities.
Two recent studies published in <em>Springer Nature</em> and <em>Cells</em> reflect this direction. In 
    <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00726-025-03448-3" target="_blank">one</a>, I conducted a complete metabolomic analysis of colorectal cancer and used weighted network modeling to identify metabolite modules associated with tumor phenotype. In 
    <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/14/14/1115" target="_blank">the other</a>, I modeled metabolomic and proteomic profiles to define subtype-specific network modules in rhabdomyosarcoma.<br>
My goal is to to develop deep learning and diffusion-based representation models that map high-dimensional molecular states into low-dimensional latent spaces. These representations provide a way to examine how biological states evolve over time, how perturbations propagate through regulatory networks, and how disease trajectories diverge from normal physiology, and more importantly, help identify interventional points where targeted perturbations could shift a diseased system toward a more stable or healthy state.
